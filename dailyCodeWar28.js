// Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it.

const square = (num) => Math.pow(num,2)

//psuedo code

// used the math.pow method as a data structure that provides an easy input to get any power of a number that you define. In this case it was square so I ran the parameter and set it to square it by useing 2. If i wanted it cubed you could just use the number 3 and so forth to get the desired power.
